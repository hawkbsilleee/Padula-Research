## data_transcription_auto 
Automates the data transcription process from FCFTester software to a google spreadsheet. FCFTester is a visual color field diagnostic test that measures a patient's visual form field. Due to the nature of the software, data must manually be transferred in order to store it externally. This program automates this process by reading a pdf that the software produces and writing it to a google sheet.
